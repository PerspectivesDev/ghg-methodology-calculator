# KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- **Simplest solution that works**: Prefer the least complex design and implementation that meets the requirement. Avoid unnecessary abstraction, indirection, or generality.
- **Readability over cleverness**: Code is read more than written. Clear and straightforward beats clever and concise when they conflict.
- **One level of abstraction at a time**: Don't mix high-level orchestration with low-level details in the same unit. Keep each function at a single level.
- **Avoid speculative generality**: Don't add parameters, options, or layers "for flexibility" until you have a concrete second use case. See YAGNI.
- **Names and structure**: If you need a long comment or a complex name to explain it, simplify the code instead.

When choosing between two approaches, prefer the one that is easier to understand and change.
