# Clean Code

## Names

- **Reveal intent**: Names should say what something does or represents. Avoid abbreviations unless universal (e.g. `id`, `url`).
- **Avoid disinformation**: Don't use names that suggest something different (e.g. a list that isn't a list).
- **Searchable**: Prefer names that are easy to search for. Avoid single-letter names except in tiny scopes (e.g. loop index).
- **Use domain language**: Prefer terms from the problem domain over generic tech terms when they clarify.

## Functions

- **Small**: Do one thing. If you can extract a named block, consider a separate function.
- **Few arguments**: Prefer 0–2 arguments. More than 3 is a smell; consider an object or breaking responsibility.
- **No side effects**: Functions should not change state or call external systems in ways callers don't expect. Name or document any side effect.
- **One level of abstraction**: Don't mix high-level steps with low-level details in the same function.

## General

- **No magic numbers/strings**: Use named constants or config. The meaning of `0.07` or `"ACTIVE"` should be obvious from the name.
- **Positive naming**: Prefer `isActive` over `isInactive`; positive conditionals are easier to read.
- **Formatting**: Consistent indentation, line length, and style. Let the formatter do the work.
