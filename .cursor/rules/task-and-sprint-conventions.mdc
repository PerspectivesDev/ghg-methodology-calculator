# Task and Sprint Conventions

## Source of truth: specs YAML

- **Sprints**: Defined in `specs/sprints.yaml` (list of sprint objects). Schema: `framework/sprints/SPRINT-SCHEMA.md`.
- **Tasks**: Defined in `specs/tasks.yaml` (list of task objects). Schema: `framework/tasks/TASK-SCHEMA.md`.
- Plan and implement from these files. When editing specs, keep IDs and `depends_on` consistent.

## Tasks

- **ID**: Unique (e.g. `S1.1`, `S2.3`). Use sprint prefix when possible.
- **depends_on**: Task IDs that must be done first. No circular dependencies.
- **test_ref**: What test defines success; create/update this test before implementation.
- **Definition of done**: Test(s) pass, 95% coverage maintained, code reviewed (if applicable).

## Sprints

- **One sprint ≈ one work package**: Typically ~2 weeks of conventional coder effort.
- **tasks** (in sprint): List of task IDs in dependency order; all must pass by end of sprint.
- **goal**: One-sentence deliverable for the sprint.

## Tracks

- **track** = theme (e.g. core, api, frontend). Sprints belong to a track.
- Tracks can run in parallel when dependencies allow.

## Estimation

- Provide **historical context** (e.g. "3 people, 2 months for similar scope") when asking for estimates.
- Ask for estimate in **days with agentic/AI-assisted development**; use as a range and re-estimate as you go.
