# General Software Engineering Rules

These rules apply to all projects derived from this scaffolding, regardless of tech stack.

## Design & Boundaries

- **One responsibility per module**: Each module has a single, clearly stated responsibility. No overlapping concerns.
- **Explicit interfaces**: Communication between modules is via defined interfaces (API, events, files). Document inputs, outputs, and error cases.
- **No hidden coupling**: Avoid shared mutable state across modules. Prefer passing data or events.

## Code Quality

- **Readable names**: Names reflect intent. Prefer clarity over brevity.
- **Small units**: Functions/methods do one thing; keep them short and testable.
- **Fail fast**: Validate inputs at boundaries; return clear errors; log context for debugging.

## Dependencies & Tasks

- **Task dependencies**: Before implementing a task, ensure its dependencies are done. No cycles in the dependency graph.
- **Test before implement**: For each task, create or update the test(s) that define success, then implement until tests pass.

## Documentation

- **Public APIs**: Document purpose, parameters, return values, and possible errors.
- **Decisions**: Record non-obvious architectural or tech decisions in ADRs or architecture docs.

## Consistency

- Follow project-specific conventions (see stack-specific rules if present). When in doubt, match existing style in the same module.
