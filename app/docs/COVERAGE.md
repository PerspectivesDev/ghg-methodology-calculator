# Test coverage

**Target: 95%** (lines, functions, branches, statements) for application code in `src/` and `client/`.

- Coverage is enforced by Vitest thresholds in `vitest.config.ts`.
- Run: `npm run coverage` (from `app/`). Report: `app/coverage/index.html`.
- Exceptions (e.g. a file excluded from threshold) must be documented here and in config.

No exceptions currently.
