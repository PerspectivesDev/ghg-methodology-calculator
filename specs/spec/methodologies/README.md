# Methodology reference docs

These files define **required inputs and formula references** so the app implements each standard exactly as in the official PDFs.

- **KOREA-REQUIRED-INPUTS.md** — South Korea Attached Form 1: list of variables (symbols) the user or Basic Data Provided must supply for exact Etotal calculation. Use for canonical input schema and Korea adapter.
- **INDIA-GHCI-REQUIRED-INPUTS.md** — India Green Hydrogen Certification Scheme (April 2025), electrolysis pathway: required inputs and structure (feedstock, electricity, fuel, steam, input materials, co-product allocation). Equation symbols and formula refs to be aligned with PDF pages 19–23 when implementing; this doc provides the structural mapping and canonical mapping.

**Rule**: All calculations must be based only on these two PDFs (and future standards’ official documents). No ad hoc formulas.
