# Your specification (project-specific)

This folder holds **your** product specification. Nothing in this repo is tech- or app-specific—you add the spec for each project.

- **SPEC-TEMPLATE.md** — Generic template (goals, scope, tech stack, modules, layout). Copy and fill for your app.
- **SPEC-STRUCTURE.md** — When to use one file vs many; suggested structure (by concern or by domain). Read this if you're unsure how to organize the spec.
- **One file** (`product.md`) is enough for small/medium apps. Split into multiple files when the spec is long, has many modules/APIs, or different owners (see SPEC-STRUCTURE.md).

Sprints and tasks derived from this spec go in `../sprints.yaml` and `../tasks.yaml`.
