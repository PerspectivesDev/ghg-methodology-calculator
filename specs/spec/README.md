# Your specification (project-specific)

This folder holds **your** product specification. Nothing in this repo is tech- or app-specific—you add the spec for each project.

- **SPEC-TEMPLATE.md** — Generic template (goals, scope, tech stack, modules, layout). Copy and fill for your app.
- Add your own files (e.g. `product.md`, `api.md`) as needed.

Sprints and tasks derived from this spec go in `../sprints.yaml` and `../tasks.yaml`.
