# Tasks — add your project's tasks here (from your spec)
# Schema: framework/tasks/TASK-SCHEMA.md
# For each task: create the test from test_ref first, then implement.

tasks:
  - id: S1.1
    sprint_id: S1

    description: "Initialize project structure and test runner for your stack. Ensure 95% coverage target is measurable. No app logic yet—just runnable tests and coverage."
    definition_of_done:
      - "Test(s) pass"

    title: First feature or slice
    depends_on: [S1.1]
    test_ref: "Tests define the behavior of the first feature (contract and/or behavior); implement until they pass."
    description: "Implement the first feature or vertical slice as defined in your spec. Write tests first, then implement. Follow your stack's best practices."
